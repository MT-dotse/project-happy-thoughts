# Happy Thoughts ðŸ’Œ

The aim of the project was to build a twitter-like app ( with less negativity ) and learn the life-cycle of a **React** component. 
I implemented an **useEffect** hook to perform actions when the components mount, unmount or when state changes. In this project I used Technigo's **Happy Thoughts API** from which I fetched previous messages from.  The app also allows users to post their own messages and to give likes to messages.

### Update:
I have created my own **Happy Thoughts API** that I included in this project. It is an Express API using MongoDB Atlas and deployed in Heroku.
API is live in Heroku here: https://mtdose-happy-thoughts.herokuapp.com/thoughts

This was a fun project with many useful React features. I really enjoyed working in React and I am looking forward to diving deeper and learning more. If I would continue to build on this project I would liked to make a counter to keep track of the number of posts.
