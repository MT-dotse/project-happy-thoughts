# Happy Thoughts
The aim of the project was to build a twitter-like app that collects and publishes happy thoughts. The projects is built using React useEffect hook, calling and fetching data from an API and putting the data into a state. 

This was an interesting project with many new features to learn in React. Although at first challenged with grapsing the flow of the fetching and posting data, I really enjoy working in react and looking forward to diving deeper. If I had more time I would liked to challenge myself to make a counter to keep track of the many different posts.
