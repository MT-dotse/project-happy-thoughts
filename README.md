# Happy Thoughts ðŸ’Œ

I built a twitter-like app ( with less negativity ) while learning the life-cycle of a **React** component. 
An **useEffect** hook was used to perform actions when the components mount, unmount or when state changes. The app uses Technigo's **Happy Thoughts API** from which I fetched previous messages from.  The app also allows users to post their own messages and to give likes to messages.

### Update:
I have created my own simple **Happy Thoughts API** that I included in this project. It is an Express API using MongoDB Atlas and deployed in Heroku.
API is live in Heroku here: https://mtdose-happy-thoughts.herokuapp.com/thoughts

This was a fun project with useful React features. I enjoyed working in React and I am looking forward to diving deeper and learning more. If I would continue to build on this project I would make a counter to keep track of the number of posts.
