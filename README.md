# Happy Thoughts ðŸ’Œ

The aim of the project was to build a twitter-like app and learn the life-cycle of a **React** component. I learned how the **useEffect** hook performs actions when the components mount, unmount or when state changes. In this project I used Technigo's **Happy Thoughts API**, fetching previous happy messages, I also enabled users to post their own messages and give a likes to the existing messages.

### Update:
I have created my own **Happy Thoughts API** that I included in this project. It is an Express API using MongoDB Atlas and deployed in Heroku.

This was a fun project with many new features to learn in React. I really enjoyed working in react and I am looking forward to diving deeper and learning more. If I would continue to build on this project I would liked to make a counter to keep track of the many different posts.
